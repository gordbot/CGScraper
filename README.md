# Canada Gazette Scraper (CGScraper)

As the [Canada Gazette](http://www.gazette.gc.ca) does not provide 
a machine readable version of its publications, CGScraper is 
intended to serve as an interim tool for programmatic access to 
the publication.


## Dependences

This project depends on the scrapy python module:
- [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)

## Install with pip
```bash
  pip install Scrapy
```

## Install with Anaconda
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scrapy
```

## Other Dependencies
The following additional modules may also be required:
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/index.html), an efficient XML and HTML parser
- [parsel](https://pypi.org/project/parsel/), an HTML/XML data extraction library written on top of lxml,
- [w3lib](https://pypi.org/project/w3lib/), a multi-purpose helper for dealing with URLs and web page encodings

  
## Contributing

This is a quick script I put together to help me process 
information from the Canada Gazette programmatically. In the 
abence of any machine readable format, there is no easy way 
to work with the important information stored within.

If you have any interest in government, government reporting, 
screen scraping, database, or front-end development, I'd love 
to hear from you. 

You can reach me here or at gordonbonnar@gmail.com.
